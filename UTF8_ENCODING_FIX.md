# UTF-8 Encoding Fix for Railway Deployment

## Problem
Railway deployment was failing due to a UTF-8 encoding issue in the file `client/lib/database.types.ts`. The specific error was:

```
Error reading client/lib/database.types.ts: stream did not contain valid UTF-8.
```

## Solution
The file was recreated with proper UTF-8 encoding to eliminate any non-UTF-8 characters that might have been present in the original file.

### Steps Taken:
1. Backed up the original `client/lib/database.types.ts` file to `client/lib/database.types.ts.bak`
2. Created a clean version of the file with identical content but ensuring proper UTF-8 encoding
3. Replaced the original file with the clean version
4. Committed and pushed the changes to GitHub for Railway to pick up

### Verification
After making these changes, the Railway deployment should now be able to read the file correctly without encountering UTF-8 encoding errors.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the Railway deployment to confirm the UTF-8 issue is resolved
2. Complete the server deployment to Railway
3. After server deployment, update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` in Vercel to the Railway server URL
4. Redeploy the client to Vercel to use the updated server URL
5. Test the full client-server integration:
   - Authentication
   - Session creation
   - Real-time collaboration features
