# üìù CollabCode Deployment Status Update

## üõ†Ô∏è Latest Changes (TypeScript Not Found Fix)

### Problem:
- Railway deployment was failing with a "tsc: not found" error
- This was occurring because TypeScript was only installed as a dev dependency, but Railway's production build doesn't install dev dependencies by default

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified package.json**:
   - Moved `typescript` from devDependencies to dependencies to ensure it's available in production
   - Updated build scripts to use `npx tsc` instead of directly calling `tsc`
   - Updated type-check script to use `npx tsc --noEmit`

2. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Enhanced the TypeScript Not Found Error section in RAILWAY_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT.md
   - Added detailed troubleshooting steps and verification process

### Next Steps:

1. **Redeploy to Railway**:
   - Commit these changes to GitHub
   - Trigger a new deployment on Railway
   - Monitor build logs to confirm TypeScript is found and used

2. **After Server Deployment**:
   - Get the deployed server URL from Railway (e.g., https://collabcode-server-production.up.railway.app)
   - Update the Vercel client's environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL with this URL
   - Redeploy the client on Vercel if necessary

3. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Test WebSocket connections between client and server
   - Verify real-time collaboration features work correctly
   - Check user authentication and session creation
